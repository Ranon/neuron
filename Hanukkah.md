# Hanukkah

Let's talk Hannukah recipes. 

## Latke

- Shred 5 potatoes in a food processor, fine.
- Shred 1 large onion in a food processor, fine.
- Add some garlic.
- Add eggs, maybe 3.
- Add flour until stiff.
- Heat a flat bottomed pan to a 7/10 heat. 
    - *Use the cast iron because the pan is hard to clean after.* 
- Once smoking, place latkes in the pan, pretty flat if possible. 
- Cook for ~2-3 minutes a side, flip once.
- Take out and let them sit. You can throw them in the oven on the lowest possible setting if it's going to be a while. Be careful, they could dry out.
