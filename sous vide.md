# Sous Vide

Let's talk sous vide recipes. 

## Steak

- In an instant pot, set the temperature to 120 F and let it get up to temp. 
- Cook for 2 - 4 hours.
- Pull the steak out and rest for 15 minutes.
- Sear using the [TS8000KC](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Bernzomatic-TS8000KC-Premium-Torch-Kit-336638/205683985) Premium Torch until browned on all sides.
    - Make sure not to put the pepper on prior to the sear, or the torch will burn the pepper creating a bitter, unpleasant flavor. 
- EAT!
