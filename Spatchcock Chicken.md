# Spatchcock Chicken

This is my go-to recipe for chicken. It's easy, very forgiving, and always flavorful. 

1. Cut the chicken backbone out. If the chicken is small, just cut the backbone in half. 
2. Flip the chicken over so it is skin side up, exposed ribs side down. Push down hard to break the ribs and flatten the chicken. 
3. Work your thumbs up the butt side of the chicken and separate the skin from the meat. 
4. Work the mayo mixture into the chicken between the skin & meat.
    5. _You can also use a dry rub here like a preferred store bought dry spice rub. Again, the recipe is very forgiving. _
6. Spread the remaining mayo mixture on both sides of the chicken. 
7. Marinate for 2 minute - 24 hours. 
8. Grill or cook ribs side down until breast reads 165. The thighs will probably be 185 at that point and still very moist. This usually takes ~20-30 minutes around 400 F.
