# Thanksgiving

Let's talk Thanksgiving recipes. 


## Turkey 

The #Turkey is obviously the main dish for Thanksgiving. Our family has tried it all sorts of ways. 

### The Best Way

Brine the turkey, then debone it and roll herbs/stuffing into it. This is a super time intensive task but will almost always produce a beautifully moist white & dar
k meat that carves well. 

1. Start defrosting the turkey 6 days in advance of thanksgiving days in advance.
2. By day 4 it should be thawed out. Start brining it. 
    3. Brines are a dime a dozen. See the very popular one below or use your own. 
4. Now you are going to cut that thing apart but keeping it as one piece. It takes about 2 hours start to finish including cleaning. 


### Brine Recipe 

You got to do it. #brine. 

1. 1 gallon Vegetable broth
2. 1 cup sea salt
3. 1 tablespoon crushed dried rosemary
4. 1 tablespoon dried sage
5. 1 tablespoon dried thyme
6. 1 tablespoon dried savory
7. 1 gallon ice water

Basically, bring all of these ingredients to a boil. Then let them cool to room temp. Throw them in a 5 gallon bucket and add the ice water. Make sure you pat the turkey dry w/o the innards. Let it go for 24 hours.
