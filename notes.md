As you were preparing tonight's talk, did you run into anything that was surprising to learn?
Was there anything that stood out as particularly surprising?

How do we deal with Suni or Shiaa Muslims as to the right path of Islam after the passing of Mohammad.  They differ greatly in their views, but we should be able to communicate with either group from a unifying perspective.

Christine - 
What form of Islam is closest to the original intention of Mohammad?

Ian - 
Was the early 'betrayal' of Mohammed's message the reason Islam went on a conquering spree after Mohammed's death? The Koran says "no compulsion in matters of religion" but the Islamic conquerors violated this for centuries. 

Mehrdad & Noushy - 
Dr Hatcher would it be right to say that if it was not because of the khalife and start of the Sunnis the spread of islam would have not been so dominant from suadi arbia to Mongolia to roman

Anonymous - 
Shiaa is the correct path, but Suni are the far greater in number.  Without telling them who is right and who is wrong, what is the best way to communicate the Baha'i view as unifying.

Jila Bayani
thank you for such beautiful talk Dr Hatcher.


James - 
A Manifestation's prophecies prove His omniscience, in this case concerning the course of His religion. Briefly,  there are no surprises even concerning the outcome of believers' behaviors. Combined with Baha'i teachings on the fact that  Manifestations will always assume responsibility for the misdeeds of Their followers, shouldn't these two facts always be applied when seeking understandings of  sacred text?
